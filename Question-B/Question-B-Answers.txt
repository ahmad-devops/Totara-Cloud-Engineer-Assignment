Question B

Totara infrastructure team needs to spin up a Jenkins instance on the AWS cloud infrastructure to run cloud CI/CD pipelines.

1.	What's your approach to spinning up a Jenkins instance on AWS cloud infrastructure?
    -- I will use terraform as IaC to deploy jenkins instance on AWS.
    -- Please refer "Question-B\jenkins-ec2.tf"

2.	If you decide to use terraform as IaC, How do you develop terraform modules to spin up the EC2 instance for hosting the Jenkins instance?
    -- Please find the module under "Question-B\ec2-module" path on the repo.

3.	How do you improve your terraform module to grant SSH access and HTTP access?
    -- I have created module with security group to allow ingress traffic , we can pass SSH and HTTP port value through var.ingressrules to whitelist them.   

4.	What's your approach to automating Jenkins and relevant dependencies installation on the EC2 instance?
    -- I have used remote-exec provisioner to automatic configure Jenkins and intall the required dependincies on the EC2 instance.
