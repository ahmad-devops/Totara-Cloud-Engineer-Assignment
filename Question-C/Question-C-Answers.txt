Question C

Totara web application released as a docker image, and it requires nginx,pgsql as dependency containers.
1.	How do you deploy the above three containers in the Kubernetes cluster?
    -- I would deploy these containers as deployments with multiple replicas to achieve high availability and scalability.
    also I would configure service, secrets and config maps accordingly.

2.	If we need to scale the nginx container based on demand how do you achieve it?
    -- This can be achieved through horizontal pod scaling. Horizontal pod autoscalar can autosacle workloads based on 
    CPU or memory consumption, or in response to custom metrics reported from within Kubernetes or external metrics from sources outside of your cluster.
    -- Please check "Question-C\nginx-hpa.yaml"

3.	How you are going to keep Pgsql DB credentials in k8 cluster?
    -- I will use Secrets to store Pgsql DB credentials. A secret is object which can store sensitive data such as passwords, token or key.
    -- Please check "Question-C\postgres-secret.yaml"

4.	How do you upgrade the totara application with zero downtime?
    -- Kubernetes supports couple of update strategies. However I will use RollingUpdate strategy as new pods are added gradually, and old pods are terminated gradually,
    Hence we can upgarde the application with zero downtime.
    -- Please refer "Question-C\totara.yaml"
